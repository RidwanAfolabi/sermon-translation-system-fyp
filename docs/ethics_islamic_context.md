# Ethics and Islamic Context

## Ethical Considerations
This project involves real-time translation of religious sermons, which requires careful
handling to avoid misinterpretation of sensitive content. The system is designed to support
understanding and inclusivity, not to replace religious scholars or official interpretations.

Accuracy, transparency, and respect for religious values are prioritized throughout the
design and deployment of the system.

## Islamic Context
Islamic sermons (khutbahs) often contain verses from the Qur’an, Hadith, and contextual
religious guidance. The proposed system aims to assist non-native speakers by providing
real-time translated text while preserving the original meaning as closely as possible.

The system does not alter, modify, or reinterpret religious content. Instead, it provides
assistance for comprehension, and users are encouraged to consult qualified scholars for
official religious rulings or interpretations.
